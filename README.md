# CFA-ATM-terminal-app

# Description  
  This is my first application that I build with Ruby.  
  Through making this applicaiton I found my passion in programming and making application.  
  
# Function & How to play  
 *Current balance is set up as $100 in this application.  
 *Open your Terminal, Sublime or something tool, and go into this file.  
 *Type "ruby 'this file name(atm.rb)'", you will be asked your name, and once you type your name your current balance($100) will be displayed. You'll be also asked whether deposit $20 or withdraw $20, you can play 10 times and each time you can see your current balance.  
  
# Challenges  
  Everything was new to me at that time so it took me days to understand the concept of ruby.
